# IPL-Data-Analysis
<br>
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of 128 matches and 29,000+ deliveries from the IPL dataset using SQL. The analysis involved executing 17+ complex queries to extract and manipulate large datasets, uncovering key player performance metrics that supported strategic decision making.
